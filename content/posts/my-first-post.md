Over the past few years in IT, Iâ€™ve encountered a wide range of challenges, technologies, and people. Here are a few things Iâ€™ve learned along the way:

### 1. **Documentation is Everything**
Writing things down saves your future self and your teammates. Whether it's a fix, a configuration, or a weird error message â€” document it.

### 2. **Backups Matter â€” Really**
Backups are only useful if theyâ€™re **tested**. Donâ€™t just assume they're working because they ran.

### 3. **Users Arenâ€™t the Enemy**
Most "user errors" are the result of unclear systems or lack of training. Be patient and listen before jumping to conclusions.

### 4. **Security is Everyoneâ€™s Responsibility**
Whether itâ€™s enforcing MFA, teaching phishing awareness, or patching systems, security isnâ€™t just an IT checkbox â€” itâ€™s ongoing work.

### 5. **Google is Your Best Friend**
Knowing where to look is just as important as knowing the answer. Even senior engineers Google solutions every day.
