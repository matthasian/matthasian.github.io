Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into Splunk â€” a powerful platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data.

### ðŸ”¹ What I've Learned So Far

- Splunk uses **forwarders** to collect logs.
- You write **search queries** in SPL (Search Processing Language).
- Dashboards and alerts are key to real-time visibility.
- It's very useful in a **SOC** environment.

This post will grow as I learn more...
